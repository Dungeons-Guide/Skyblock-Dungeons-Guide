# Dungeons Guide
The most intelligent Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons Mod
## Safety Concerns 
Moulberry (NEU developer) and Danker (DSM developer) and staff for both discord server (Bestower) have confirmed that this mod is safe, for further details please check [this](https://hypixel.net/threads/about-the-dungeons-guide-mod.3727014/) forum post. You can also read the code yourself if you do not trust us. 
## Features
- Dungeon Waypoints
  - Waypoints for every things that are interactable in dungeon.
  - NPC, Secret, Door, Lever, Superboom wall, Crypts
  - Q. Hey is this feature bannable?
  - A. No.
    1. It is not Watchdog detectable since it does not modify player behaviour or packet
    2. It is not an ESP (unlike some other "secret waypoints" mods which are really just ChestESP and ItemESP). This mod bases the waypoints on a static set of coordinates from a corner of the room a player is in. This is similar to fairy soul waypoints (which Simon has confirmed are allowed) since it is not scanning for the secrets but rather displaying a waypoint over a set coordinate.
    3. It does not break any of the 4 guidelines recently posted by Fr0z3n about disallowed QOL modifications
    4. It does not provide an unfair advantage. Players who memorized secrets will always be able to find secrets faster than someone who hasn't memorized secrets and is using waypoints.
